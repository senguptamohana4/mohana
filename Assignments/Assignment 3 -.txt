*Calculating Fctorial:-

Function:

factorial(n)
Input: n (integer)
Output: factorial of n (integer)

1. If n is less than 0:
   - Return an error message indicating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
2. If n is 0:
   - Return 1 (by definition, 0! = 1).
3. Otherwise:
   - Initialize result = 1.
   - Loop from i = 1 to n:
       3.2.1. Multiply result by i.
   - Return result.

*Calculating nth Fibonacci Number:-

fibonacci(n)
Input: n (integer)
Output: nth Fibonacci number (integer)

Pseudocode:

1. If n is less than or equal to 0:
   1.1. Return 0 (by convention, the 0th Fibonacci number is 0).
2. If n equals 1 or 2:
   2.1. Return 1 (by convention, the 1st and 2nd Fibonacci numbers are both 1).
3. Otherwise:
   - Initialize variables a = 1, b = 1, and temp.
   - Loop from i = 3 to n:
   - Set temp = a + b.
   - Set a = b.
   - Set b = temp.
   - Return b.
